# Regex Tutorial

Regular expressions, often referred to as regex, are powerful tools used for pattern matching and text manipulation. They consist of a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Regex can be used in various programming languages and text editors to perform tasks such as validating input, searching and replacing text, and extracting specific information from text.

In this tutorial, we will break down each component of a regular expression and describe what it does. 

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.
