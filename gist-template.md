# Regex Tutorial

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for working with text data. They allow us to define patterns and search for specific strings within a larger body of text. In this tutorial, we will dive into the fascinating world of regular expressions by exploring a specific regex that is commonly used for validating email addresses.

Email addresses are an essential form of communication today, and being able to validate and extract them accurately can be incredibly valuable. By using a well-crafted regex, we can ensure that the email addresses we work with meet the necessary formatting requirements.

In this tutorial, we will dissect a regex that matches email addresses and break down each component to understand its function. We will explore anchors, quantifiers, character classes, grouping, and other essential elements of regex syntax. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of how the regex works and how to utilize it effectively.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will explore a regular expression (regex) that matches email addresses. Email addresses have a specific format, and using a regex can help validate and extract them from text. The regex we will be examining is:

/^[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.[\w.-]+$/

We will break down each component of this regex and explain its function in order to understand how it works.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are symbols that represent the position of the regex match within the text. The ^ symbol at the beginning of our regex represents the start of the line, and the $ symbol at the end represents the end of the line. Together, they ensure that the entire string is matched from start to finish.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many times a certain element should occur. In our regex, the + symbol is a quantifier that matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element. For example, [\w.-]+ matches one or more word characters, dots, or hyphens.

### OR Operator
The OR operator, represented by the | symbol, allows us to provide alternative matches for a specific position. However, in our email regex, we do not use the OR operator.
